Hemisphere Suite: Alternate Alternate Firmware for Ornament and Crime
===

This is a fork of the Hemisphere Suite with some custom changes:

1. It compiles with PlatformIO and VS-Code
2. Add some original apps from OC firmware like Quantermain, Viznut Tracker, Quantermain, Sequins, Darkest Timeline and eliminates Enigma, Neural Net and Pong
3. NEW: Random Walk Applet: Dual channel (X/Y) clocked random walk with selectable range and step (CV controllable). A smoothing parameter can be used to morph stairs-like random walk to much more smooth walk. The second channel can be triggered using the first channel trigger signal with a configurable division.
4. Adds new Hemisphere applet Stairs and TB-3PO by Logarhythm1 (https://github.com/Logarhythm1/O_C-HemisphereSuite/)
5. Adds new Hemisphere applet Shredder and DrumMap by Ben Rosenbach (https://github.com/benirose/O_C-BenisphereSuite/)
6. Some HEM apps were also removed (CVRecV2, DrCrusher, GatedVCA, BootsNCat, Binary, LoFiPCM, LowerRenz, Trending, Palimpsest, Squanch, MixerBal, RunglBook, Vector*)
