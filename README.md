Hemisphere Suite: Alternate Alternate Firmware for Ornament and Crime
===

This is a fork of the Hemisphere Suite with some custom changes:

1. It compiles with PlatformIO and VS-Code
2. Add some original apps from OC firmware like Quantermain, Viznut Tracker, Quantermain, Sequins, Darkest Timeline and eliminates Enigma, Neural Net and Pong
3. Adds new Hemisphere applet Stairs and TB-3PO by Logarhythm1 (https://github.com/Logarhythm1/O_C-HemisphereSuite/)
3. Some HEM apps were also removed (CVRecV2, DrCrusher, GatedVCA, BootsNCat, Binary, LoFiPCM, LowerRenz, Trending, Palimpsest, Squanch, MixerBal)

### firmware:

Hemisphere Suite is an open-source project by Jason Justian (aka chysn)

ornament**s** & crime**s** is a collaborative project by Patrick Dowling (aka pld), mxmxmx and Tim Churches (aka bennelong.bicyclist) (though mostly by pld and bennelong.bicyclist). it **(considerably) extends** the original firmware for the o_C / ASR eurorack module, designed by mxmxmx.
