Hemisphere Suite: Alternate Alternate Firmware for Ornament and Crime
===

This is a fork of the Hemisphere Suite with some custom changes:

1. It compiles with PlatformIO and VS-Code
2. Add some original apps from OC firmware like Quantermain and Viznut Tracker and eliminates Enigma, Darkest timeline, Neural Net and Pong
3. Some HEM apps were also removed (GatedVCA, BootsNCat, Binary, Trending, Palimpsest, TrigSeq16, EnvFollow, Squanch, MixerBal)

### firmware:

Hemisphere Suite is an open-source project by Jason Justian (aka chysn)

ornament**s** & crime**s** is a collaborative project by Patrick Dowling (aka pld), mxmxmx and Tim Churches (aka bennelong.bicyclist) (though mostly by pld and bennelong.bicyclist). it **(considerably) extends** the original firmware for the o_C / ASR eurorack module, designed by mxmxmx.

### hardware:

eurorack / teensy 3.2 DAC8565 quad 16bit CV module w/ OLED display

14HP, depth ~ 25mm
